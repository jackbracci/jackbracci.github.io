      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>My name is Jonathan Bracci and I am a Senior pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Information with a focus in Information Analysis at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor School of Information, while minoring in Business and Entrepreneurship. What began as an interest in data, soon developed into a passion analyzing business trends. Along with the data-analytic skills I am pursuing in IT through my major I will need to pair them with financial analytic skills in business to help me accomplish my goal as a consultant. As an analyst with IT skills I will help the business side merge technologies together to solve businesses challenges and create financial models to help make the proper decision. About two percent of data is ever analyzed. That is why it is important to integrate it properly and analyze what is important to find the best solution. </p>

        <p> My education in analytics, entrepreneurship and Business has thus far been instrumental in teaching me the characteristics and qualitative skills necessary to succeed on your team. To be successful, you must learn how to deliver a value proposition that is better than that of anyone else. To do so requires creativity, innovation, flexibility, and grit. Perhaps the most important of those traits is grit; grit implies not only hard work, but the ability to take feedback, to adjust, to persevere, and work with a variety of people to ultimately achieve success. I am applying for the position because I believe I possess these traits, and want to utilize my skills within the work environment. Along with the projects that have pushed me to become an innovative thinker. Please check out my projects to see my skills that I have acquired while at the University.</p>
