      <h2>More About Jonathan</h2>

      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>Jonathan Bracci is currently a senior at The University of Michigan. He is completing a Bachelor of Science with a focus in Information Analysis. He also will obtain two minors: Entrepreneurship and Business. He will be moving to Philadelphia next year where he will be doing Business Analytics Consulting with IBM.</p>


      <h3>Career Interests</h3>

      <p>What began as an interest in data and one day owning my own business, soon developed into a passion for information and entrepreneurship while I was immersed into my information major studies.  Along with the data-analytic skills I am pursuing in IT through my major I will need to pair them with financial analytic skills in business to help me accomplish my ultimate goal as a technology business consultant.  A consultant with IT skills is expected to help the business side merge technologies together in order to solve businesses challenges.</p>
      <p>As a consultant one cannot look at past trends or try to create or solve problems that are already being solved. As I have learned in my SI major, technology and information are increasing at an exponential rate and with the Millennial generation it will not slow down any time soon. Data analytics allows for businesses to deliver value much more quickly and to a more significant effect. However, to do this effectively you must be able to analyze trends and predict what is going to happen before it occurs. Otherwise you will have missed a business opportunity to gain leverage.</p>
